      <h2>Education and Training</h2>
      <p><strong>PhD in Statistical Science</strong>, UCL (02/2025 – Current), London, UK.<br> Working on Bayesian sensitivity modeling, specifically conducting prior sensitivity analysis using Stein discrepancy.</p>
      <p><strong>Master of Science in Machine Learning, Data Science and AI</strong>, Aalto University (09/2021 – 05/2023), Espoo, Finland.<br> Final grade: 5.0/5.0</p>
      <p><strong>Bachelor of Computer Science with minor in economics</strong>, Saint-Petersburg State University (09/2017 – 06/2021), St. Petersburg, Russia.<br> Final grade: 4.9/5.0</p>

      <h2>Research Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>Research Assistant in Probabilistic Machine Learning</strong> (09/2022 – 02/2024).<br> Developed Bayesian nonparametric methods for modeling individualized treatment-response curves from noisy, sparse time
      series. Focused on deriving a multi-output Gaussian Process (GP) model using coregionalization to incorporate information across individuals and treatments. Built on Conventional GP, Latent Force (ODE-based), and Convolved GP models. Stack: Python
      (GPflow), R (Stan).</p>
      <p><strong>Research Intern in Statistical Machine Learning</strong> (06/2022 – 09/2022).<br> Developed a multi-output Bayesian regression model for multi-trait phenotypic analysis with grouped genetic eﬀects. Improved
      Gibbs sampler reduced covariance estimation error and cut runtime by nearly one-third. Stack: Python, C++.</p>
      <p><strong>Research Assistant in Explainable Machine Learning</strong> (11/2021 – 05/2022).<br> Worked on Explainable Empirical Risk Minimization, developing and testing ML optimization methods that integrate user
      experience as a regularizer.</p>
